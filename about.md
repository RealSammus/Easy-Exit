# Easy Exit

No more waiting around, just **<cy>tap</c>** to skip the screen to leave a level **<cg>instantly</c>**.

After completing a level your screen will tint based on your settings, then you just **<cy>click</c>** to **<cp>return</c>** to the menu of your choice.

## <cr>Optional settings:</c>

• Returning to either the **<cp>Level Screen</c>** or the **<cp>Levels List</c>**

• The **<cg>tint colour</c>** shown when you can click to exit the level

• The **<cy>opacity</c>** of the tint colour shown
